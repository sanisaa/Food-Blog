		<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

<li>1 tsp baking soda divided</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves unpeeled</li>
<li>3 tbsp fresh lemon juice or to taste</li>
<li>1/3 cup tahini</li>

<li>1/8 tsp ground cumin</li>

<li>Place chickpeas and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda in a medium bowl and add cold water to cover by 2 inches. Cover and let sit, at room temperature overnight, until chickpeas have doubled in size. Drain and rinse.
In a large saucepan, combine the soaked chickpeas and remaining 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and add cold water to cover by at least 2 inches. Bring to a boil, skimming if needed. Reduce the heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer until chickpeas are tender and squish easily between your fingers, about 45â€“60 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>

<li>While the chickpeas are cooking, place the garlic, 2 tablespoons + 2 teaspoons of the lemon juice, and tahini in a blender or food processor and pulse until smooth. With the motor running, Add the ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time (it may seize up at first) until mixture is very smooth, pale, and thick. </li>

<li>Add the drained chickpeas and cumin and process, scraping down the sides as needed, until very smooth, about 4 minutes. Thin with water if a looser consistency is needed. Taste and season with lemon juice, and cumin, as desired.</li>

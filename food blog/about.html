<h1>What is Food Blogging?</h1>

<div class="about">
    <h2>Food Blogging</h2>
    <p>Food blogging represents a complex interweaving of “foodie” or gourmet interest in cooking with those of blog writing and photography. The majority of blogs use pictures taken by the author himself/herself and some of them focus specifically on food photography.<p>
        <p>There are different types of Food blogging 
            <ul>
                <li>Recipes</li>
<li>Food/Restaurant Review</li>
<li>Food and Travel (Ethics and Culture)</li>
<li>Food Photography</li>
</ul>
<p>As long as it is about food it is considered as food blog. Most often a food blog has overlapping elements of all or some of these elements. A blog is a personal journal and there is no real rule of writing a food blog.</p>

<h2>Food photography</h2>
<p>For many people, it's the visual appeal of food alone that draws their interest towards many food photographers/bloggers.Food photography is simply product photography with a focus on food. Food photographers aim to show, share, and persuade by photographing food arranged in a well lit, diligently arranged background. Unlike the other types of food blogging, food photographers have a specific mission to take the best possible photos and videos of food. Professional food photography is usually a collaborative process involving multiple people including a director, food and prop stylists, photographers, etc.</p>

<h2>Effects on the foodies</h2>
<p>Even though most bloggers aren't necessarily experts in their area of practice, this doesn't discourage online traffic. In fact, influencer audiences are highly reactive to content like photos, videos, precise instructions or descriptions with regard to the flow of cooking, eating, or even dieting. The loyalty consumers exhibit to bloggers they follow present those bloggers with inconspicuous business opportunities. The majority of feedback is positive and suggestive.For the most part, people follow these blogs to experiment with new recipes, become aware of new food trends, restaurants, and other creative ideas these thought leaders have to offer.Primarily, foodies and popular bloggers are informative and persuasive, having been posed between consumers and producers. As a result, huge parts of the culinary landscape have sparked a new level of public interest. Cookbooks have made a comeback, popular chefs are treated like celebrities, and dieting trends have gained more momentum than ever.All of this can be attributed to the easily read content that bloggers post. The impact of processing or cognitive fluency is in play when discussing the most impactful blog posts, the bloggers who write, make visual demonstrations, guides, and other content that is easily digestible for consumers often yield the most feedback not only in terms of likes, but comments and shares as well. Being a food expert has almost nothing to do with running a successful food blog. The bloggers persona, persuasion, and engagement style are the main components, aside from content, are main determinants of the amount of influence a blogger gains.</p>

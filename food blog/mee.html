    <p>Hey Everyone!!!</p>
    <p>Hailing from a working class family, I am sanisha. I am simple, sweet, confident and cunning fellow.<br><br>

        What I have learned, from the very start is the importance of passion, dedication, confidence and time management. We are two brother and sister among my parents. My family is what my parents had worked for, i.e completely happy and satisfied one.<br><br>

        I am the students of bachelor.I am currently studying in Nepal College Of Information Technology. My elder brother has already finisted his Masters.<br><br>

        I wake up early in the morning and finish up all of my doings. We all pack up for our respective works.Its true to say that a child becomes what the environments he gets in his home. All the essential humane qualities like sincerity, dedication, truth and honesty I do experience practically at my home.<br><br>

        I enjoy moonlight strolls, red roses by the armfull, and participation dances.My friends would describe me as easy going and a good listener.I do work for what I dream. So far, I try to prove myself being the best one in all fields like in academic, extracurricular and in personal domains. All of this success, hard work, dedication, determination is truly credited to my parents who have made this possible for me.<br><br>
My family, especially my mother, has been the much source of encouragement and motivation for me. That is why I myself am a truly self inspired, strengthened and dedicated fellow today. I have learnt a lot from my mistakes and from my failures. I never regard my failure as a curse rather an opportunity to improve and to improvise.What I myself regard life is a total pot of opportunities. One has to harness one’s skills and abilities to the maximum of one’s capacity. For every problem there is a solution. I regard the life as a blessing gift to humanity. One should strive hard to improve not only his lot but for his fellow beings.<br><br>
The service of humanity is the best of all services. What I have learnt myself from my experience and struggles is that one should never cease working hard, be confident, positive and adoptable to all situations. The biggest success is that one becomes invincible. Only than, one can face the life in a full vigor and fullest of confidence.Therefore, writing about myself, I m here to express myself that what I see, what I experience and what I plan for my life is the total manifestation of what I do today. I try myself to be humble, passionate, dedicated, hardworking and honest.

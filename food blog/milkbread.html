		<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>120 grams water warm</li>
			<li>1 tsp active dry yeast</li>
<li>250 grams bread flour</li>
<li>30 grams sugar</li>
<li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
<li>1/2 large egg lightly beaten, about 1.5 tbsp (28 grams)</li>
<li>25 grams butter room temp</li></ul>

<h2>INSTRUCTION</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Sprinkle the yeast onto the warm water/milk. Let proof while you complete the next steps</li>
	<li>In the bowl of your mixer, stir together the flour, sugar and salt.</li>
	<li>Whisk the egg into the yeast mixture, then add to the dry ingredients. Use a wooden spoon to mix until it comes into a ball and then switch to a dough hook and knead until the dough pulls away cleanly from the sides</li>
	<li>Add the room temperature butter and continue to knead, about 10-12 minutes, until very supple and the dough reaches the windowpane stage – take a piece of dough about the size of a golf ball and stretch it out between your fingers and thumbs. If you can stretch it without the dough breaking, you’re good to go. Transfer to a clean bowl and cover with plastic wrap.</li>
	<li>Place in a warm spot and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
	<li>Take the dough and tip it out onto a lightly floured surface. Punch down lightly then roll out into a large oval</li>
	<li>Bring the two sides of the oval towards the middle</li>
	<li>Then roll up.Place in a pullman loaf pan (I used a non-stick pan, lightly oil or butter your pan if it isn’t non-stick), cover and let proof until 1 inch below the top, about 40 minutes to 1 hour. Heat the oven to 355°F after the dough has been proofing for 30 minutes.
</li>
<li>Slide the lid on the pan and bake for 40 minutes to 1 hour or until the bread is golden and cooked through. Remove from the pan immediately and cool on a wire rack. Slice and enjoy!</li></ol>
